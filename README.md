Please check back soon for CosmoLike routines, we're still making it a bit more user friendly.

If you're looking for forecasts from the paper with axis scales like ![this one](https://github.com/elikrause/CosmoLike_Forecasts/blob/master/plots/LSST_indi_vs_multi.pdf "LSST multi-probe forecasts"), have a look at the plots folder.
